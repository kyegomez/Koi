# Install
`pip install koi-x`

# Usage
```python
import torch
from torch import nn
from copy import deepcopy
import numpy as np

from koi import Koi



# Define a simple task
class SimpleTask:
    def __init__(self):
        self.a = np.random.uniform(-5, 5)
        self.b = np.random.uniform(-5, 5)

    def f(self, x):
        return self.a * x + self.b

    def sample_data(self, n=100):
        x = np.random.uniform(-5, 5, n)
        y = self.f(x)
        return torch.Tensor(x).unsqueeze(-1), torch.Tensor(y).unsqueeze(-1)

    def loss(self, model):
        x, y = self.sample_data()
        y_pred = model(x)
        return ((y - y_pred)**2).mean()

# Define a task distribution
class SimpleTaskDistribution:
    def sample(self):
        return SimpleTask()

# Initialize the model
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(1, 1),
)

# Initialize Koi
koi = Koi(model, step_size=0.01, num_steps=10, num_iterations=1000)

# Sample a task and perform a forward pass
task = SimpleTaskDistribution().sample()
x, y = task.sample_data(n=1)
y_pred = koi.model(x)
print(f"Output before training: {y_pred.item()}")

# Train Koi on tasks
tasks = SimpleTaskDistribution()
koi.train(tasks)

# Perform a forward pass after training
y_pred = koi.model(x)
print(f"Output after training: {y_pred.item()}")

# Inference on new data
x_new, y_new = task.sample_data(n=1)
y_pred_new = koi.model(x_new)
print(f"Output on new data: {y_pred_new.item()}")

# Architecture

The Koi algorithm is a meta-learning algorithm that aims to find an initialization for the parameters of a neural network such that the network can be fine-tuned using a small amount of data from a new task. It works by repeatedly sampling a task, performing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on it, and updating the initial parameters towards the final parameters learned on that task.

## Atomic Operations
-----------------

The Koi algorithm can be broken down into the following atomic operations:

1.  Initialization: The algorithm starts with an initial parameter vector for the model. This can be random or based on some prior knowledge.

2.  Task Sampling: In each iteration, the algorithm samples a task from the task distribution. This task is a learning problem that the model needs to solve.

3.  SGD on Task: The algorithm performs several steps of SGD on the sampled task. SGD is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent.

4.  Parameter Update: After performing SGD on the task, the algorithm updates the initial parameters towards the final parameters learned on that task. This is done by taking a step in the direction of the final parameters, scaled by a learning rate.

5.  Iteration: Steps 2-4 are repeated for a specified number of iterations. Over time, this process should move the initial parameters towards a region of the parameter space that is good for all tasks.

6.  Return Final Parameters: After all iterations are complete, the algorithm returns the final parameters. These parameters can then be used as a good initialization for future learning tasks.

## Why It Works
------------

The Koi algorithm works because it effectively performs a form of joint training across all tasks. By updating the initial parameters towards the final parameters learned on each task, it encourages the model to find a region of the parameter space that is good for all tasks.

The key insight behind the Koi algorithm is that a good initialization for a learning task is one where a small number of SGD steps will result in good performance. By performing SGD on each task and updating the initial parameters towards the final parameters, the algorithm is effectively training the model to be good at "learning quickly" from a small number of examples.
